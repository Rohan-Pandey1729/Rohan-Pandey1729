# Hi there, I'm Rohan Pandey ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate applied mathematician and machine learning enthusiast interested in open-source projects, reinforcement learning, rocketry, and cancer research. I love building intelligent systems, exploring reinforcement learning, and optimizing machine learning models for real-world applications.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in machine and reinforcement learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about High-powered Scientific Computing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that make a difference.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about math, AI, or anything tech-related!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing Tennis, Monopoly, and flying rockets!

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Python, Java, C++
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, React, Node.js
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Tools: Git, Docker, Bash, Slurm
- Other: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Data Analysis, Mathematical Modeling

## Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/Rohan-Pandey1729/tdmpc2): In our project, we explored whether we could distill the planning process in model-based RL into the policy network. Instead of using a dynamics and reward model to sample future trajectories, we aimed to mimic this planning with just a neural network as the policy, eliminating the need for computationally intensive planning.

- [Project 2](https://github.com/Rohan-Pandey1729/NREIP-Blade-Element-Theory-ML): A MATLAB/Python project using RL to optimize aerodynamic efficiency with a Simulink-based physics model, DDPG agent, and airfoil analysis.

- [Project 3](https://github.com/Rohan-Pandey1729/Telemetry_System): Using Blender and a telemetry system I developed, I created a rocket animation that updates based on sensor data collected and plotted by a C++ script of a rocket during its flight.
